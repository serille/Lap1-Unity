# Lap1-Unity

This is a copy of Jump'n'bump, a game by Brainchild Design made in 1998. Made with Unity.

## About The Project

This project was made for learning and practicing making 2D Games with Unity. It uses the original game's assets but does not reproduce the original game accurately.

Since this project is just for learning and practice, expect bugs and general wonkiness. 

**If you just want to play the game I'd highly recommend to get it from Jump'n'bump's GitLab page:** https://gitlab.com/LibreGames/jumpnbump

## Build

Just add this folder as a Unity project, you should then be able to build from the Unity editor.

## How to play

Start the game by reaching the right side of the main menu screen. <!-- Uncomment when implemented: Every player on the right side of the fallen tree trunk will be part of the game. -->

Controls (standard US QWERTY layout):

- Player 1 (Dott): arrow keys (left, right and up)
- Player 2 (Jiffy): W (up), A (left), D (right)
- Player 3 (Fizz): P (up), L (left), ' (right)
- Player 4 (Mijji): G (up), V (left), N (right)

These controls are layout-independent, and are located where the mentioned keys are located on a US QWERTY keyboard even if you are using other layouts. For example AZERTY keyboards would use Z, Q and D for Player 2

The game have no end, just Alt+F4 or close the window when you're done with it. <!-- Uncomment when implemented: Press ESC to end the game and access the final scoreboard. Press ESC again to loop back to the main menu.-->
